# SuperTicTacToe
# This game was created as a final project for a masters Python course. 
# The code consists of two games, a basic Tic Tac Toe game for two players as well as a Super Tic Tac Toe variant that consists of one large board made of smaller boards. 

# In order to run the program the main file just needs to be run. Everything required is within the game file.

# As for the mechanics of the game, it is only 2 player where turns are alternated. 
# All ties are solved using Rock Paper Scissors best out of three rules.
